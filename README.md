## This is a repository containig the COA take home challenge By Sage Byiringiro
 
 within this challenge i was asked to make 
 
 # 1. an interactive photo gallery that can be accessible using any device and browser 
 # 2. solve two problem solving challanges in java script

 so the folders that are found within this directory one contains the photo gallery and another one contains solution to the challenges that I was given.

 `they also contain step by step procedures on how to install and run them!`
