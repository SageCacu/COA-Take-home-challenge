# Coding Challenges By Sage Byiringiro

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to two coding challenges.

## Challenges

### 1. Array Manipulation (`arrayMap.js`)
Determines if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target sum.

### 2. String Transformation (`stringTransform.js`)
to transform a given string based on specific rules.

## how to run these two challenges

* first you need a coding editor for me I used Visual studio code
* 2nd you need to have node.js installed in your pc 
 
 then to run any of these :

 --> open your code editor 
 --> open its terminal
 --> type node 'derectory name'/'filename.js'
        ex: node challenges/arrayMap.js

    then it passes all the test.

    bingo!!
